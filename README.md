### Demo

This blog app let users write blog entries once they **sign up with an account**. After the user registers, he can go to the homepage and login with his credentials. The navigation bar will dynamically show different items depending on the user being logged in or out. 

Once logged in, the navigation bar will have a `Log Out` tab. There will also be a `New Post` tab where the user can create a **new blog post** and upload an associated **image file**. When he goes back to the Home page, his blog entries will be posted there with the `username` and `date posted`.
